## Architecture

The app follows a **modular architecture** based on **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern, combined with **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring high maintainability, scalability, and testability.

### Key Components:
1. **Model:** Handles data representation, including interaction with APIs like Firestore for train schedules and news articles.
2. **View:** The user interface, built using Flutter widgets, reacts to state changes in the ViewModel.
3. **ViewModel:** The intermediary between Model and View, managing the business logic and state updates using **Riverpod** for efficient state management.

### Clean Architecture Layers:
- **Presentation Layer:** Contains View Models and UI components, handling user input and reflecting changes in the state.
- **Domain Layer:** Manages business logic, independent of UI, ensuring flexibility for future modifications.
- **Data Layer:** Manages data operations, fetching information from APIs and local databases.

## Backend & Data Management

- **Firebase Firestore:** Real-time database for user authentication, train schedules, and news articles.
- **Shared Preferences:** Lightweight storage for user preferences and application states .
- **RESTful Services:** Interaction with Firebase APIs through asynchronous HTTP requests, ensuring smooth client-server communication.

### Caching & Offline Support
- **Firestore Offline Persistence:** Ensures access to previously loaded data (like news articles) when the device is offline.
- **Shared Preferences Caching:** Stores small, persistent data like user preferences across app sessions.

---

## State Management

The app uses **Riverpod** for managing state across different modules such as **news**, **train booking**, and **authentication**:
- **Scoped State Management:** Each module has its own state, ensuring isolated and efficient updates.
- **Providers and Listeners:** UI components listen to state changes in the ViewModel, automatically updating when data changes.

---

## Modular Approach

The app is divided into multiple modules for different functionalities:
- **Auth:** Handles user login, registration, and password management.
- **News:** Displays news articles and hot news, with search capabilities.
- **Train Booking:** Manages train selection, ticket booking, and payment options.
- **Onboarding:** Guides users through the initial setup.
- **Settings:** Allows users to edit profile and manage application preferences.
